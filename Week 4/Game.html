        <p>FIFA, football (soccer) electronic game series developed by EA Sports, a division of the American gaming company Electronic Arts, and licensed from the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). EA Sports began the FIFA series in 1993, hoping to develop a hold on football in the same way that they dominated the market for American gridiron football gaming with Madden NFL.Starting with FIFA International Soccer, EA Sports created a handful of additions for 16-bit electronic game systems and the Sega CD. Unfortunately, the game included only national teams and was plagued by a bug that allowed for easy goal scoring. FIFA Soccer 95 was released for personal computers and the Sega Mega Drive. FIFA Soccer 96 was the first in the series to offer real-time three-dimensional play on the systems of the time. FIFA titles released by EA Sports seemed to lag behind the competition in some game-play aspects, however, until a series of overhauls in 2006 improved the control of the game and presented new features such as an in-depth career mode, which adds various coaching features.</p>
